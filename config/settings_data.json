          "text-block-1": "<p><strong>THE BEGINNING</strong></p>\n<p>In 1946, a curious soon-to-be nurseryman named Floyd Dillon decided there was a need for a California version of the dwarf apple and pear. He chose citrus as the ideal candidate. As he later wrote in 1959: \"What better specifications could be written for the ideal patio plant than to take everything offered by the standard commercial citrus and dwarf it to patio size, capable of being grown in a box or tub, raised bed or border, either espaliered or in its natural form?</p>\n<p>\"The orchard citrus of most species and cultivars grows in a dense, globular form. Its evergreen foliage is clean and attractive, with almost a continuous showing of fragrant flowers or waxy colorful fruit. It is decorative, interesting, and productive.</p>",

          "text-block-2": "<p><strong>THE BIRTH OF FOUR WINDS</strong></p>\n<p>Floyd learned that researchers at UCLA and UC Riverside were already experimenting with new varieties and different rootstock-scion combinations. A scion is a twig or branch of a superior eating variety grafted to roots of another variety to improve disease resistance, production, control tree size or modify other characteristics.</p>\n<p>Dr. Bill Bitters and other citrus researchers worked with Floyd to create dwarf trees that had beautiful foliage and tasty fruit. This was achieved by trials with rootstock/scion combinations. Suitable propagation techniques were employed to create the trees designed for patio and backyard growing.</p>\n<p>After several years of experimentation, Floyd founded Four Winds Growers. The California company is currently located in&nbsp; Watsonville, CA.</p>",
          "image-2": "shopify://shop_images/MG_5303-002.jpg",
          "text-block-3": "<p><strong>TODAY</strong></p>\n<p>Today, dwarf citrus is a common sight in nurseries throughout the West and is grown successfully in containers throughout the world. The adaptability of dwarf citrus to container growing has made them increasingly popular outside of traditional citrus growing areas. They are most easily moved indoors for winter protection and outdoors in the warm seasons.</p>\n<p>In addition, dwarf citrus has become important to gardeners whose gardening space is limited to patios, balconies and small porches.</p>\n<p>It seems that Floyd Dillon and his dwarf citrus nursery were well ahead of their time. As interest of non-commercial gardeners grows, more varieties of citrus are becoming available on dwarf rootstocks.</p>",

Over the holidays, he met his newest great grandson-Ripley Else. He is survived by wife, Mary Ann, daughters Mary Helen Seeger (John), Debbie Dillon Adams (Warren) Don Dillon Jr. (Donna) along with 6 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren. In January, his thoughts were on the &ldquo;Super Bowl No Load Football Fund,&rdquo; managed this year by his granddaughter, Lexa Dillon.</p>\n<p>Don was born in El Centro, California, the only child of Floyd and Mildred Dillon. He graduated from Stanford University, married his college sweetheart, Mary Ann Walker, and served in the US Navy, aboard Destroyer Escorts in both the Atlantic and the Pacific.&nbsp; He retired with the rank of Commander.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>He joined his father, Floyd, in the nursery business in the early 1950's in Piru, CA.&nbsp; They moved their fledgling nursery, with the help of Fred and Barbara Real, to Mission San Jose in 1954 to escape the Citrus Tristeza Quarantine. Four Winds Growers has been supplying citrus and other edibles to Northern California ever since. He was proud that his family; son Don Dillon, Jr., grandson Aaron Dillon, granddaughter Lexa Dillon, daughter Mary Helen, son in law John Seeger are carrying on the business, with the able assistance of Mike Andrade, the Perez family and other valued team members growing in three locations in Fremont, Winters and Watsonville. Don Sr. will continue to be an inspiration for all of us at Four Winds.</p>\n<p>Don also made time to actively be involved with many other pursuits. He was known for his energy, enthusiasm, sincere interest in others and his &ldquo;can do&rdquo; attitude toward building consensus and meeting goals for the benefit of all.&nbsp; He was into &ldquo;social networking&rdquo; before the term was ever coined.</p>\n<p>In 1960, he was a charter member of Western Region of the International Plant Propagators, and then served as its President and also President of the International Plant Propagators. The IPPS motto &ldquo;Seek and Share&rdquo; was unconventional in the horticulture business, but Don embraced it. He became President of Saratoga Horticulture Research Foundation. He was a big supporter of California Association of Nurseries and Garden Centers, enjoying meetings at Peninsula and Central Chapters. He and Mary Ann enjoyed worked in the Monterey Heritage Gardens, especially the care of the espalier apples trees. His advice to all gardeners was rather than &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to plants, to &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to them.</p>\n<p>He wanted to be remembered as the &ldquo;Formerly Honorable Mayor of the City of Fremont&rdquo; where he served as Mayor for 5 years, as well as 16 years on the Fremont City Council.&nbsp; He was a driving force in establishing Lake Elizabeth and a beautiful 400 acre park in center of town. He worked to save historic homes and ranches in the Fremont area.&nbsp; The Japanese garden at the Shinn Park was a project he and Mary Ann worked on with other people for many years. He served as President of the Association of Bay Area Governments and on numerous other intergovernmental agencies, including the Alameda Creek-Coyote Hills Joint Agency and the Metropolitan Transportation Commission.</p>\n<p>Don was very active in the Niles Rotary.&nbsp; The Rotarian &ldquo;Four Way Test&rdquo; and &ldquo;Service above Self&rdquo; were more than mottos for Don.&nbsp; It was a way of life for him.&nbsp; He inspired many with a smile and a phrase he would use in parting, &ldquo;Have a POW-ER-FUL- DAY!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>"

I ordered this tree as a replacement for one that my girlfriend bought me for Christmas form a local nursery, which really was nothing more then a stick in a pot. (now sadly it's quite literally a stick in a pot)\nYour 2-3 year old tree, on the other hand, looks great. It has many new branches, lots of flowers, and even a small limequat growing on it already. To tell the truth it puts the Meyer lemon (that I also got from the local nursery) to shame.\nYour shipping is fantastic. It only took 2 days to arrive here, and cast about a third of what a grower in Georgia quoted me.\nI would just like to say thanks again, and that I'm sure I'll be ordering another tree from you soon."

By adding some pea-size pumice to the soil/redwood shavings and planting in a much smaller container, the root system will get a quick drink with rapid drainage and then the soil will dry out much faster for the roots to go searching for what available water is left in the pot...I also used a 3/4\" wood bit and drilled extra holes in the bottom and sides of the smaller container...this insures proper drainage and airing out...\nIt's amazing that in about 3-4 days, the soil now tests at a \"1\" on the moisture meter!!! I think I have it finally figured out....the container size for the 2-3 yr root balls had been fouling me up....I always used a 10x12 that was indicated on the sheet with the plants...by dropping back to an 8x8\", there's enough soil to grow, yet not enough for the roots to stand and rot....it will be easy to see when the tree becomes root bound and that will be the next size to plant up...\nThis tree's leaves really look healthy and it arrived without any major shake-ups, unlike the last tree that got nipped (during our spring warm-up) in UPS transit with that crazy week of sub freezing temps back here...\nAgain, many thanks to you for sending the replacement....also my warmest wishes to Toby and Mary. and the family...\nWarmest, warmest regards...and again, many thanks Kerry for caring and the great customer service that you and FourWinds show your loyal customers...\nYour Illinois citrus friend,\n\nAL Willcoxen\n\nLater he wrote:\nMy eureka and oro blanco trees are doing grand!!!!! I have lemons and grapefruits that are about the size of tennis balls; by repotting in much smaller containers and adding pea-size pumice to the soil, the soil is just right for drying out quickly!!! Plus, I use only collected rain water on the plants so there is no salt build-up in the soil or required leaching!!! That's a plus when it comes to watering here in the midwest...\"God-given\" rain droplets that the plants can all enjoy (smile)...\nKeep in touch...I'm finally producing lemons!!!!!!!!!!!!\nWarmest wishes,\nAl"

One day, I decided that I would like to \"throw my hat into the citrus growing arena.\" I started to search the Internet for any information about growing citrus as a house plant. I stumbled across Four Winds Growers' web site. They have a slogan, \"We don't sell trees, we sell satisfaction.\"\n\nI ordered a one-year old Trovita Orange tree. The ordering process was a breeze and the web site contained tons of helpful growing instructions. The tree arrived in great condition. It came in its own pot and the leaves were green and full of life. I have seen other trees shipped as dried up twigs, so I was pleasantly surprised when Four Winds Growers sent me a live plant. I have been caring for the tree, as per the instructions and am being rewarded with lots of dark green glossy growth. In fact, I wake every morning to find new growth. The tree also fills the room with a fragrant aroma. Imagine your room smelling like freshly peeled oranges. I'm anxious to see the big fragrant flowers and fruit appear. It is such a joy to watch it grow. I invite everyone to enjoy citrus trees from Four Winds Growers."

I have beautiful sweet smelling blossoms on three of my trees, my lemon, my lime and my grapefruit. My orange doesn't have any blossoms on it yet even though it is very green & lush but I have hope that if will follow the others someday soon. I also have actual little lemons & limes on the limbs right now and they are about 1 1/2 inches long and are bright green. My house smells so wonderful and sweet that when people come over they say \"What is that awesome smell, it's nothing like I have ever smelled before?\" and I then show & tell them about my precious little dwarf citrus trees.\n\nPeople are amazed that I am growing them in my dining room and that they came from California across the country to this little town of Swansea in Massachusetts and are absolutely gorgeous. As a matter of fact one of my friends just ordered two trees from Four Winds and she lives in Fall River, Massachusetts, a neighboring city to the town of Swansea and she adores her trees as well. I can't help but spread the news about Four Winds Growers.\n\nYou send people such fine quality products that you put the trust back in our minds again and enable us to not fear buying from growers because the outcome is exactly what Four Winds professes to grow. Even your pamphlet is extremely helpful if you have any questions or problems, not to mention the fact that you can simply call or e-mail any concerns that you have regarding the care & maintenance of your trees and then get a very helpful & quick response back. I just love Four Winds. It is a pleasure to have these four beautiful trees in my own home and be able to actually enjoy the fruits of my labor. Thank you so much and God bless America!"

I bought the 2-3 year old trees and had them shipped UPS (and they were absolutely worth the price, by the way). I was completely dumbfounded at the excellent shape of both the trees when they arrived.\n\nI had ordered a lemon tree from a different company about 5 years ago. I received a dead-looking twig in the mail. I still have the tree and it's still alive, but it has never bloomed. Anyway, I lowered my expectations for these trees so I wouldn't be disappointed, but I still kind of hoped they would at least look like they were alive. I have to say, these trees were unbelievable. They were both green, full and loaded with new growth. I potted them both immediately and got them in a southern exposure window right away. The lemon tree already has 13 flowers budding out! The orange tree has tons of new growth but I can't tell yet if it will be leaves or flowers.\n\nI cannot tell you how happy I am with both of these trees and the excellent, courteous service I received from everyone that I dealt with at Four Winds Growers. You have delivered service and product way beyond expectation.\n\nI am, at this moment, trying to figure out where I could possibly make room for another tree in my house, Because when I do, I will be ordering a lime tree also. I'll be in touch!\n\nThank you,\n\nDr. Valerie J. Cox"

It came when promised and I was thrilled to see a green healthy tree that had been carefully prepped for the 3000 mile journey to Upstate New York. My 3 year old daughter and I transplanted it outside (a day above freezing here in February is something to enjoy and it keeps the floors cleaner.)\n\nI treated it as you recommended, gave it southern exposure inside, and waited. It's been about four weeks. The tree has sent out many new branches and has literally dozens of buds, some of which are opening. The perfume is as heady as tropical wine. My 3 year old daughter looks at the tree every morning to see what has changed since the day before.\n\nI'm delighted. The treatment I received from you has been excellent, ranging from knowledgeable and enthusiastic people answering my questions, to literature guidance, to delivery as promised of what turned out to be a superb example of quality nursery goods at what seems to be an extremely reasonable price given its exotic nature. It may not be exotic to you, but blossoming dwarf citrus trees halfway between New York City and Montreal are certainly not an everyday commodity!"

The 3-year lime arrived with 8 tiny limes already on it, and has plumped those up and added at least a dozen more tiny ones. Both trees are still blooming and setting fruit!

It has still got a hundred or so and my greenhouse is smelling really great these days!!! The Lemon is taking a little longer to get settled in but it is sending out new leaves so no problem.

              "tip": "<p>Growing citrus trees in the ground can be immensely rewarding, and it naturally produces the biggest and most vigorous specimens. However, before planting a citrus tree in the ground, you must determine whether or not the location you have in mind will provide a suitable home for your new dwarf citrus tree.</p><p><strong>How Will Citrus Look In My Yard?</strong><br/> Sometimes people aren't quite sure about using citrus as a landscape plant. In fact, citrus work extraordinarily well in most any landscape, offering beautiful evergreen foliage, lovely (and fragrant) blossoms, and colorful fruit.</p><p><strong>Size</strong><br/> Citrus trees purchased through our mail order website are all grafted on semi dwarf rootstocks that are perfect for container growing. If planted in the ground dwarf trees can be expected to reach Semi-Dwarf size – up to around 16 feet in height, depending upon variety. In a pot, the semi dwarf trees will stay much smaller, especially with judicious pruning. Standard size citrus trees, available at California nurseries, grown in the ground and can be expected to get much taller – up to 25 feet, depending on variety. Be sure to provide more space in the ground for standard size trees. Generally, a Semi Dwarf tree needs an 8-10 foot diameter space, while a Standard tree should be provided with a larger growing space – up to 15 feet in diameter.</p><p><strong>Climate</strong><br/> In general, ground-planted citrus trees are happiest in warm, temperate areas. Some varieties are much more frost-tolerant than others. For information on a specific variety, please refer to our hardiness table.</p><p><br/> <strong>Location</strong><br/> A sunny, frost and wind-free location with southern exposure is best. If in doubt about the location, leave the tree in its plastic container and place it in the spot you have in mind. Water as needed, and after a week or two you should be able to tell whether or not it's happy.</p><p>Reflected heat from sidewalks, walls, driveways, or other structures can help to create a warmer \"microclimate.\" Avoid planting citrus trees in lawns that get frequent, shallow sprinklings. Don't crowd your tree, for even though it is a Semi Dwarf, it will need room for its eight-ten foot ultimate diameter. The root system can reach far beyond the drip line.<br/> <br/> <strong>Soil</strong><br/> Citrus trees are famous for tolerating a wide variety of soils, including clay. However, good drainage is essential, as citrus trees can't survive standing water for long. To test your drainage, dig a hole 30\" deep where you would like to place the tree. Fill with water to saturate the soil. The next day refill it with water. Your drainage is OK if the water level drops 2\" in two hours. If the water does not drain well, plant your tree in a raised bed and then amend the soil as described in the following paragraph.<br/> <br/> Soils rich in humus are best. For heavy or poor soils, we recommend digging a large hole and filling it back in, half with the best of the original soil, and half with a good-quality amendment mix. Plant the root ball high to allow it room to settle over time. Crown roots should remain just below the soil line.<br/> <br/> <strong>Planting</strong><br/> If the plant is growing in a container, gently invert the container to remove the soil intact. Trees that are somewhat dry will usually release more easily from the pot for transplanting. Squeezing the sides of a plastic pot can help to loosen the soil and roots. </p><p>Take note of the abundant fibrous root system. Straighten out any circling roots and cut off any broken or dead roots before planting. Amend your planting hole as described above. Do not add fertilizer to the soil while backfilling your hole; however, you can apply some to the soil surface after planting. Be sure to tamp soil lightly as you go and water thoroughly after planting to eliminate any large air pockets. Stake the tree as needed until well-established. Green plant tie is a good choice for tying trees to stakes.<br/> <br/> Citrus trees are best planted during the active growing season. In summer it is best to plant in the early morning hours when temperatures are cool to moderate. Try to keep the roots out of the sun as much as possible. Water the tree thoroughly after transplanting. If desired, use a solution of Vitamin B-1 Rooting Tonic in the first few irrigations to help fine feeder roots recover more quickly. You may wish to pinch off fruit and blossoms for the first year or two after a new planting to encourage stronger root and branch development.<br/> <br/> <strong>Watering</strong><br/> Consistency is the key with citrus watering! As with so many plants, citrus trees like soil that is moist but never soggy. How often to water will vary on the environment and depends on soil porosity, tree size, and temperature. Allowing the top of the soil to dry slightly is OK. A simple moisture meter, available at garden supply stores, can be used to determine moisture down to about a 9” depth. Generally, when the meter indicates root moisture level of about 50%, (center of dial) it is time to water. Always store your moisture meter dry between uses to keep it functioning properly<br/> <br/> A wilted tree that perks up within 24 hours after watering indicates the roots got too dry. Adjust watering schedule accordingly. A tree with yellow or cupped leaves, or leaves that don't look perky after watering can indicate excessive watering and soggy roots. In that case, water less frequently.<br/> <br/> In the ground, citrus prefer less frequent, deep watering to frequent, shallow sprinklings. Creating a watering basin around the drip-line of the tree can aid in deep watering. As the tree grows, be sure to expand the basin as needed to keep it as wide as the spread of the branches. Deeper watering promotes deeper root growth and strengthens your tree. Generally, once-a-week watering works well for in-ground plantings. Be sure to adjust based on weather conditions! In general, it is best to water in the morning, but if plants are dry or wilted it is better to water them immediately, rather than wait until morning. </p><p><strong>Mulches</strong><br/> Liberal use of mulches will conserve precious water and help inhibit weed growth. A 2-3 inch layer of redwood shavings, fir bark, compost, or other organic matter can be very helpful for water retention. To reflect heat and hasten fruit ripening, some people mulch with light colored gravel or crushed rock. “Living mulches” such as nitrogen fixing clovers can also be planted between trees in an orchard. To avoid root diseases, always keep grasses and other vegetation away from the root collar area. Keep all mulches at least six inches away from the base of the trunk.<br/> <br/> <strong>Suckering</strong><br/> Know where the graft union is on your tree. It can usually be seen as a diagonal scar between 4 and 8 inches from the soil. Remove all shoot growth below the graft. These so-called \"suckers\" take vitality from the top of the tree (the fruiting wood). Especially on young trees, they are very vigorous. Remove suckers as soon as they are observed. </p><p><br/> <strong>Thorns</strong><br/> Juvenile fruiting wood will sometimes have thorns. This is a young plant's way of defending against grazing animals. As the tree matures, thorns will not appear as often. Prune off thorns if desired.</p>"

              "title-tip": "An excellent choice for growing citrus in any climate.",
              "tip": "<p>Citrus trees are especially suited for container growing as they can be kept at manageable sizes. Container growing allows gardeners to overcome poor soil conditions or limited space in a landscape. People enjoy their trees in decorative pots on a patio or apartment balcony. Many customers have cold winters and bring their citrus indoors during freezing weather. These tips can help you on the way to successful citrus growing in containers.</p><p><strong>Selecting Planting Containers</strong> <br/> We recommend 10-14\" or 3-5 gallon container for our primo trees. A variety of decorative plastic containers are available at reasonable prices. Clay pots and wooden containers are attractive but less mobile choices. When selecting a container, be sure there are sufficient drainage holes. Drilling extra holes is an easy way to improve drainage with wood or plastic. As the tree grows, increase the container size to a 16-20\" diameter pot (the next pot size up). Do not start with a pot that is too large as it makes soil moisture levels harder to control with small trees.</p><p><strong>Selecting a Location for Outdoor Containers</strong></p><p>Provide 8 or more hours of direct sunlight per day. If less than 6 hours of natural full sun is provided, supplement with grow lights. Usually an unobstructed South or Southwest facing window is ideal. Sunny, wind free locations with southern exposure are the best. If in doubt, leave the tree in its plastic container and place it in the spot you have in mind. After a week or two, you should be able to tell whether or not it is thriving. Reflected heat from sidewalks or houses can also help to create a warmer microclimate. Avoid placing containerized citrus trees on or near lawns that get frequent, shallow watering. To reduce excessive heat on the roots, try nesting plain plastic nursery pots into slightly larger decorative pots. This can help roots stay cooler. Be sure the pot never sits in standing drainage water. </p><p><strong>Selecting a Soil Mix for Container Planting</strong></p><p>We recommend using commercially available potting mixes. Some experts make their own mixes using wood shavings, sand, and compost. Using dirt (native soil from your yard) in a container is not advisable. We also advise against putting gravel or any other material on the bottom of the pot, as this negatively impacts drainage over time.</p><p>The perfect high porosity soil mix can be hard to find. Soils that are too heavy can be amended with about 1/3 –1/2 the volume of 1\" redwood shavings or cedar hamster bedding. Pine and spruce shavings tend to break down more quickly, so are not ideal. Try to select hardwood chips that will last longer. If necessary, moisten the mix to reduce dust and make it easier to handle.</p><p>Use a soil mix that is lightweight and drains well. If the mix contains a large proportion of dense, absorbent material, such as peat moss or worm castings, amend with 1/4-1/3 volume of 1\" cedar or redwood shavings. Water in thoroughly, using Vitamin B-1 rooting tonic in the first few applications, if desired. Once the roots have settled, we prefer using slow release fertilizers applied to the soil surface, rather than mixing fertilizer into the soil or using plant stakes. This avoids any risk of burning the roots.</p><p>When shopping for the perfect citrus soil mix, please avoid those that contain chemical wetting agents or fertilizers. Soil mixes formulated for outdoor use are preferable to potting mixes for indoor plants, since the later often contain chemical wetting agents, causing tree roots to remain too wet after watering. You can start with a good rich organic soil and amend with about 1/3-1/2 volume shavings, perlite or coco fiber. Mixes for Cactus/Citrus have a lot of sand but can work. Use your judgment to amend as needed.</p><p><strong>Planting in Containers</strong></p><p>Once your soil mix is prepared, the container is selected and the tree's eventual location is known, you are ready to begin potting.</p><p>Place prepared soil mix in the bottom of your new container. Gently slide tree roots out of the old container, trimming off any dead roots and detangling any circling roots so that growth into the new pot will not be impeded. If planting a bare-rooted mail order tree, gently shake the shavings loose from the roots and mix them with the planting mix. Place the loosened root mass into the new container and gently fill with your fresh planting mix, packing down lightly to remove large air spaces from the root zone. The top of the roots should be just beneath the soil surface, and crown roots (root collar area) should show above the soil line. Make sure that soil or mulch is not pushed up against the trunk of the tree. Water deeply. Stake loosely with green tie if needed. It’s a good idea to repot every year or so, or when you see roots peeking through drainage holes.</p><p> <strong>Watering in Containers</strong></p><p>Consistency is the key with citrus watering. Citrus trees require soil that is moist but never soggy. Develop a watering schedule so the roots maintain even moisture, but are not waterlogged. Watering frequency will vary with soil porosity, tree size, and environmental factors. Generally, once or twice a week deep watering works well for container specimens. It is best to water in the morning, but if plants are dry or wilted it is better to water them right away than wait until morning. Elevate pots above standing drainage water.</p><p> </p><p>Water before leaves show wilting, and when roots have reached about 50% dryness. Even if the top of the soil is dry, check the moisture level in the soil surrounding the roots before watering. A wilted tree that perks up within 24 hours after watering indicates the roots got too dry. Adjust the watering schedule accordingly. A tree with yellow or cupped leaves, or leaves that don't look perky after watering can indicate excessive watering and soggy roots. Give your tree water less often.</p><p><br/> A moisture tester can be an excellent tool to help determine when roots are in need of a drink. Because most commercial moisture testers rely on an electrical conductivity method, however it is possible to get miss-readings due to high salinity or other conditions. An alternative method recently shared by a New England citrus enthusiast simply employs a plain wooden dowel about the diameter of a pencil. Sharpen it with a whittling method (sharp knife) or pencil sharpener. Then insert this into the pot at varying depths, shallow to deeper, determining moisture using your direct senses (feel, smell, etc.).<br/> As the previous example of an alternative moisture tester shows, indoor citrus trees inspire innovation! There is no one “right” soil mix, except all the ones that now contain happy citrus trees. People over the years and in every state have experimented, using locally available materials and resources to develop methods that work for them.</p><p><br/> If the adventure feels daunting you can start slowly with one of these three “easiest to grow” trees: Meyer lemon, Bearss lime, Trovita orange. </p>"

              "tip": "<p><em>Citrus trees can thrive</em> under organic production methods. The basic requirements of <em>full sun, excellent drainage, plus protection from frost and wind</em>, apply equally to organically grown trees. <em>All Citrus trees are heavy feeders</em>, and require <em>a steady supply of nitrogen and trace elements throughout the growing season</em>, whether grown in pots, or the ground.</p><p><strong>Container Growing</strong><br/> An ideal organic container mix will contain a variety of soil ingredients. When mixed thoroughly together, the blend should be friable, rich and fast draining, yet moisture retentive.</p><p>Start by combining commercial organic soil with compost, sand and fir bark, or choose from materials in your local area to create a suitable growing medium. Cedar shavings (hamster bedding), Coco shell fiber, pumice, decomposed granite and other materials can be used to help improve the saturation quality of heavy potting mixes and soils. Compost and worm castings can also be used, but keep them to under 20% of the total mix, or it may become too heavy. <em>Citrus do like a slightly acid growing medium</em>, but adding too much sphagnum moss for this purpose can impede root drainage, so use sphagnum sparingly. <em>Avoid commercial mixes that contain chemical wetting agents or chemical fertilizers. Moist, not wet roots make a happy tree.</em></p><p>A 2-3 year old bare-rooted organic tree from Four Winds Growers should be planted in a standard 5 gallon size nursery pot (12-14” diameter). Containers designed for nursery use typically have adequate drainage holes. If using a terra cotta or clay pot, be sure to drill extra holes to improve drainage, or nest the plain pot inside the decorative pot, being sure to elevate the pot above the drainage area. Putting gravel or any other material on the bottom of the container when potting up is unnecessary, and can impede drainage over time, leading to water-logged roots. Make sure that when finished planting, the tree’s crown roots show just above the soil line.</p><p><strong>Planting in the Ground</strong></p><p>It is best not to plant your citrus tree in a lawn since lawns will compete with the tree for nitrogen and water, and allopathic chemicals from grasses can impede citrus growth. In heavy clay soils it may be necessary to plant on a mound to assure good drainage.</p><p>Citrus trees are heavy feeders, and our experience has been that you need to fertilize your organic trees more often, because organic fertilizers are generally not as concentrated as conventional commercial fertilizers. Good organic granular fertilizers are available on line and at garden centers. [Two examples are Dr. Earth (Organic #9 for Fruit trees) and EB Stone (Organic Citrus and Fruit Tree Food).] You can also top dress with compost or use brew your own compost “teas” to supplement fertilization.</p><p>In addition to timely applications of slow release granular fertilizers it is a good idea to apply foliar sprays of fish emulsion and kelp on a weekly schedule throughout the active growing season. Young leaves that have not yet “hardened off” (are about half of mature leaf size) absorb foliar nitrogen and trace elements best.</p><p>See details on planting in the ground.</p><p><strong>Aphid, Scale or Mite, Oh My!</strong><br/> Be sure to check your trees at least once a week for pests or other problems.<br/> Indoors and out, you can use bi-monthly soap solution sprays, toothbrush scrubber tool in hand, to combat the arrival of unwelcome aphids, scales, mites and others. Stress caused by insufficient light , excessive dust, or over- or under- watering will predispose trees to pest attack.</p><p>Be sure that ants are excluded from your citrus growing area. An excellent product to help keep trees clean and free of pests is Organic Orange TKO. If a scale infestation has already begun, one can simply scrub them off of branches and twigs with a soft toothbrush and wash off with the solution mixed in a spray bottle. [<a href=\"http://tkoorange.com/\">http://tkoorange.com/</a> ].</p><p><strong>Bringing Indoors for Winter Growing</strong><br/> If citrus trees must spend long winter months indoors it is best to provide a sunny window that provides the perfect “California-like” indoor climate. When bringing trees indoors after a summer in the sun, please remember to consult your moisture tester and <em>make certain that at the time of transition, the roots are about 50% dry.</em> If you make sure plants you intend to bring in for the winter are a bit on the ‘dry side of moist’ it will help them adjust better to the new indoor conditions. Water them as soon as they are situated in their new winter home. To increase indoor ambient humidity you can place trays of pebbles and water below trees or use a mist bottle. Remember, <em>happy citrus roots are moist, but never soggy</em>. If your indoor growing space does not provide at least 8 hours of full sun per day, fruiting and growth may be compromised.</p><p>There is a ‘learning curve’ with citriculture, especially if you are planning your mini orchard in pots that you will need to bring indoors in winter. If you take care to maximize sun exposure, carefully monitor soil moisture, fertilize regularly and watch for pests, your organic citrus growing experience will be successful.</p>"

Foliage growth can occur in the shade, but leaves will tend to be larger than normal and shoots longer than normal. At least six hours of full sun a day is required.  Provide 8 or more hours of sun per day for optimal fruit production.</p><p><strong>If your tree grows at a rapid rate and has for years, it's possible that a rootstock sucker has taken over</strong>. Our citrus trees graft line can be seen as a diagonal scar between 4 and 8 inches above the soil line. Remove all shoot growth below the graft. These so-called \"suckers\" take vitality from the top of the tree (the fruiting wood). Especially on young trees, they are very vigorous. Remove suckers as soon as they are observed.</p><p><strong>Have there been blooms on the tree that haven't set fruit, or small fruit that haven't developed to maturity? </strong> If fruit or bloom drop is excessive, proper watering is often the solution. Extremely hot, dry, windy weather will trigger fruit drop. Be sure trees are well watered in these situations. Excessive fruit drop accompanied by splitting fruit is the result of too much water uptake. Lack of proper fertilizer will also cause fruit drop. An undernourished tree cannot support fruit development.</p>"

Citrus trees need a minimum of 6 hours of full sun to grow. If growing indoors, it's possible that your trees will do better with a grow light for the winter. A sudden change in lighting or humidity can cause problems, so be sure to move your tree gradually from one spot to another, or from inside to out.</p><p>If your tree receives adequate light, and experiences leaf drop, improper watering is probably the culprit. A lack of water can cause the tree to dry out and lose leaves, while excessive watering can cause the roots to rot, so that they lose the ability to take water and nutrients up to the leaves. If you modify watering to provide even moisture, often the tree will recover, albeit slowly. A moisture meter is useful to be certain that watering is necessary, and can help you develop an appropriate watering schedule.</p><p>Should your tree lose all its leaves, don't despair. You can prune it back lightly to help push new growth; then, with improved growing conditions (adequate light, correct watering) it should recover. Remember also to feed regularly with a good citrus fertilizer (2:1:1 ratio or similar).</p><p>Check your tree regularly for pests. Severe infestations of scale insects, or mites can cause defoliation. Regular monitoring will help you to take action in time, before severe stress (defoliation) occurs.</p>"
